# 🌱 GreenBank Simulator  
### A GreenTEK DIGITALS Project

GreenBank Simulator is a frontend-only digital banking experience designed to demonstrate how modern financial interfaces can be built with **clarity**, **sustainability-inspired design**, and **developer-first architecture** in mind.

Built under my personal brand **GreenTEK DIGITALS**, this project reflects a belief in technology that is calm, transparent, and forward-looking, inspired by nature, trust systems, and next-generation digital products.

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists (DevRel Context)

GreenBank Simulator was created as a **developer advocacy demo project**, designed to show:

- How frontend systems can simulate backend logic
- How UI can be state-driven without a database
- How financial flows can be modeled with clarity
- How product thinking meets code structure
- How to present projects professionally

This makes it ideal for:
- Junior developers learning architecture
- DevRel demos
- UI system explanations
- Product walkthroughs
- Frontend portfolio case studies

---

## ✨ Core Concepts

### Single Source of Truth
All UI and logic are derived from one authoritative state object.

### Ledger-Based Transactions
Balances are computed from event logs, not mutated directly.

### Security Patterns
Role separation, PIN steps, audit metadata, and session guards simulate backend logic.

### Deterministic UI
The UI always reflects the same state for the same inputs.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Netlify (Hosting)

No frameworks. No libraries. Pure fundamentals.
